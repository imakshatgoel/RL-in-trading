## Week-3

In this week we would understand mdps and how RL problems are mathematically formulated.
Firstly, watch lecture 1 and 2 from this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzuuYNsE1EZAXYR4FJ75jcJseBmo4KQ9-

After that read chapter 3 from the book: https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf

Refer to Grokking textbook provided with this week and complete the assignment in the notebook assignment_3.ipynb

Apart from that we would also learn how to extract financial data from yahoo finance and interpret it to make meaningful observations
finance.ipynb is the file for that, I am not giving any task on that right now I just want you to go through it once and understnad what all these represent

You can google or chatgpt terms like rolling mean, close price, adjusted close, dividends and all to know about these. I find this better than going through any text :)

I think this week is quite heavy so better keep constantly trying, ask us if you are stuck with anything

### All The Best!!
