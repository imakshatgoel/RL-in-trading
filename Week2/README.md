Then, you will work on the Multi-Arm Bandit Problem from Sutton and Barto.

Read chapters **1 and 2** from Sutton and Barto and implement the **greedy** and **epsilon-greedy** algorithms given in the `work_on_bandits.ipynb` file.

Observe how one algorithm is better than the other and make the required changes.

**Good Luck!**
